# PhotoTuner 

PhotoTuner is a image editing app built with Python and Tkinter that allows users to quickly enhance and crop their images. It offers both standard and advanced modes to easily adjust your photos using everything from simple style filters to fine-grained adjustments such as sharpness, contrast, and color enhancement.

## Features

- **Live Image Preview** with original aspect ratio
- **Advanced Mode**: Sharpen, Contrast, and Color Boost sliders
